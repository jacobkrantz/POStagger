just RB
the AT

if CS

what WDT

the AT

we PPSS

then RB
think VB

the AT

and CC
you PPSS
see VB
that CS
we PPSS

a AT

it PPS

for IN

an AT-HL
octillion CD-HL

now RB
let VB
us PPO
see VB
where WRB
this DT
power NN
comes VBZ
from IN

to TO
grasp VB
our PP$
new JJ
view NN
of IN
the AT
atom NN
, ,
we PPSS
have HV
to TO
appreciate VB
first OD
of IN
all ABN
how WQL
small JJ
the AT

i PPSS
have HV
been BEN
trying VBG
to TO
make VB
this DT
clear JJ
to IN
my PP$
own JJ
class NN
in IN
chemistry NN
. .
one CD
night NN
there EX
were BED
some DTI
dried VBN
peas NNS
lying VBG
on IN
our PP$
kitchen NN
table NN
, ,
and CC
these DTS
peas NNS
looked VBD
to IN
me PPO
like CS
a AT
little AP
group NN
of IN
atoms NNS
; .
; .
and CC
i PPSS
asked VBD
myself PPL
a AT
question NN
: :
suppose VB
i PPSS
had HVD
the AT
same AP
number NN
of IN
peas NNS
as CS
there EX
are BER
atoms NNS
in IN
my PP$
body NN
, ,
how WRB
large JJ
an AT
area NN
would MD
they PPSS
cover VB
? .
? .
i PPSS
calculated VBD
first RB
that CS
there EX
are BER
about RB
an AT
octillion CD

in IN
the AT
average NN
human JJ

; .

that DT
is BEZ
a AT
figure NN
one CD
with IN
27 CD
ciphers NNS
, ,
quite ABL
a AT
large JJ
number NN
. .
then RB
i PPSS
calculated VBD
that CS
a AT
million CD
peas NNS
would MD
just QL
about RB
fill VB
a AT
household NN
refrigerator NN
; .
; .
a AT
billion CD
peas NNS
would MD
fill VB
a AT
small JJ
house NN
from IN

; .
; .
a AT

peas NNS
would MD
fill VB
all ABN
the AT
houses NNS
in IN
a AT
town NN
of IN
about RB
ten CD
thousand CD
people NNS
; .
; .
and CC
a AT
quadrillion CD
peas NNS
would MD
fill VB
all ABN
the AT
buildings NNS
in IN
the AT
city NN
of IN
philadelphia NP

i PPSS
saw VBD
that CS
i PPSS
would MD
soon RB
run VB
out RP
of IN
buildings NNS
at IN
this DT
rate NN
, ,
so CS
i PPSS
decided VBD
to TO
take VB
another DT
measure NN
-- --
the AT
whole JJ
state NN
of IN
pennsylvania NP
. .
imagine VB
that CS
there EX
is BEZ
a AT
blizzard NN
over IN
pennsylvania NP
, ,
but CC
instead RB
of IN
snowing VBG
snow NN
, ,
it PPS
snows VBZ
peas NNS
; .
; .
so CS
we PPSS
get VB
the AT
whole JJ
state NN
covered VBN
with IN
peas NNS
, ,
about RB
four CD
feet NNS
deep JJ
. .
you PPSS
can MD
imagine VB
what WDT
it PPS
would MD
look VB
like CS
going VBG
out RP
on IN
the AT
turnpike NN
with IN
the AT
peas NNS
banked VBN
up RP
against IN
the AT
houses NNS
and CC
covering VBG
the AT
cars NNS
; .
; .
pennsylvania NP
thus RB
blanketed VBN
would MD
contain VB
about RB
a AT
quintillion CD
peas NNS
. .
but CC
we PPSS
still RB
have HV
a AT
long JJ
way NN
to TO
go VB
. .
next RB
we PPSS
imagine VB
our PP$
blizzard NN
raging VBG
over IN
all ABN
the AT
land NN
areas NNS
of IN
the AT
entire JJ

-- --
north JJ-TL
america NP-TL

south JJ-TL
america NP-TL

europe NP
, ,
asia NP
, ,
and CC
africa NP
, ,
all QL
covered VBN
with IN
peas NNS
four CD
feet NNS
deep JJ
; .
; .
then RB
we PPSS
have HV
sextillion CD
peas NNS
. .
next RB
we PPSS
freeze VB
over RP
the AT
oceans NNS
and CC
cover VB
the AT
whole JJ
earth NN
with IN
peas NNS
, ,
then RB
we PPSS
go VB
out RP
among IN
the AT
neighboring VBG
stars NNS
, ,
collect VB
250 CD
planets NNS
each DT
the AT
size NN
of IN
the AT
earth NN
, ,
and CC
also RB
cover VB
each DT
of IN
these DTS
with IN
peas NNS
four CD
feet NNS
deep JJ
; .
; .
and CC
then RB
we PPSS
have HV
septillion CD
. .
finally RB
we PPSS
go VB
into IN
the AT
farthest JJT
reaches NNS
of IN
the AT
milky JJ-TL
way NN-TL
; .
; .
we PPSS
get VB
250,000 CD
planets NNS
; .
; .
we PPSS
cover VB
each DT
of IN
these DTS
with IN
our PP$
blanket NN
of IN
peas NNS
and CC
then RB
at IN
last RB
we PPSS
have HV
octillion CD
peas NNS
corresponding VBG
in IN
number NN
to IN
the AT
atoms NNS
in IN
the AT
body NN

so RB
you PPSS
see VB
how WQL
small JJ
an AT
atom NN
is BEZ
and CC
how WQL
complicated VBN
you PPSS
are BER

a AT-HL
speck NN-HL
-- ---HL
and CC-HL
space NN-HL
now RB
although CS
an AT

is BEZ
small JJ
, ,
we PPSS
can MD
still RB
in IN
imagination NN
have HV
a AT
look NN
at IN
it PPO

let VB
us PPO
focus VB
on IN
an AT
atom NN
of IN
calcium NN
from IN
the AT
tip NN

the AT
bone NN
of IN
my PP$

and CC
let VB
us PPO
suppose VB
that CS
i PPSS
swallow VB
a AT
magic JJ
alice NP

growing VBG

i PPSS
start VB
growing VBG
rapidly RB
and CC
this DT
calcium NN
atom NN
grows VBZ
along RB

me PPO

i PPSS
shoot VB
up RP

out RP

out RP

until CS
i PPSS
am BEM
over RP
a AT

fifty CD
million CD

then RB
this DT
atom NN

calcium NN
will MD
swell VB
to IN
something PN
like CS
a AT
great JJ
balloon NN
a AT

across IN

a AT

big JJ
enough QLP

put VB
a AT

and CC
if CS
you PPSS

step VB
inside RB
of IN
such ABL
a AT
magnified VBN
atom NN
, ,
according IN
to IN
the AT
physics NN
of IN
forty CD
years NNS
ago RB
, ,
you PPSS

see VB
circulating VBG

down RP

and CC
under IN
your PP$

some DTI
twenty CD

these DTS
balls NNS

moving VBG

great JJ

ellipses NNS

the AT

the AT

negative JJ
electricity NN
which WDT

create VB
the AT
forces NNS
that WPS
tie VB
this DT
atom NN

calcium NN

the AT
neighboring VBG
atoms NNS
of IN
oxygen NN
and CC
make VB
up RP
the AT

structure NN
of IN
my PP$

since CS
these DTS

you PPSS
may MD
wonder VB
whether CS
there EX
is BEZ
an AT
atomic JJ
sun NN
at IN
the AT
center NN
of IN
the AT

so CS
you PPSS
look VB
down RP
there RB

you PPSS
see VB
a AT
tiny JJ

whirling VBG
point NN
about RB
the AT

this DT

even RB
if CS
the AT

big JJ
enough QLP

this DT

still RB
only RB

it PPS

that WPS

it PPS
also RB

nearly RB
all ABN

you PPSS

there EX

the AT
answer NN
is BEZ
nothing PN
-- --
nothing PN
