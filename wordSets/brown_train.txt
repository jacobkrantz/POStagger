90% NN

I PPSS

it PPS

some DTI

I've PPSS+HV
tried VBN

When WRB

my PP$

Even RB
that DT

If CS

they'd PPSS+MD
rather RB

Gloriana NP

they PPSS
also RB

the AT

so CS
the AT

The AT

It PPS

mostly RB

it PPS

this DT
: :
A AT

in IN

A NP-TL

The AT

alternately RB

thus RB
keeping VBG
the AT

thereby RB
making VBG
a AT
fascinating JJ

of IN
the AT
whole JJ

The AT
really QL
remarkable JJ
thing NN
to IN
me PPO
is BEZ
that CS

Whether CS

this DT

it PPS

This DT

such JJ
soggy JJ

looked VBN

In IN

the AT

jam VB
his PP$

This DT
negative NN

however WRB

an AT

You'd PPSS+MD

they've PPSS+HV

there EX

that CS

a AT
chance NN

Obviously RB

Robby's NP$

It's PPS+BEZ
the AT

If CS

which WDT

There EX

just RB

He'll PPS+MD

But CC
they PPSS

Breeding NP-HL

Gentile NP

He PPS

his PP$

When WRB

I PPSS

This DT

at IN

Some DTI

say VB
that CS
the AT
length NN

too QL
long JJ

There's EX+BEZ
a AT
reason NN
for IN
this DT
length NN

stay NN
. .
First OD
of IN
all ABN
, ,
the AT
admitting VBG
physician NN
in IN
the AT
VA NN
hospital NN
gets VBZ
the AT
patient NN
as CS
a AT
new JJ
patient NN
. .
He PPS
has HVZ
no AT
experience NN
with IN
this DT
veteran's NN$
previous JJ
medical JJ
record NN

If CS
the AT
doctor NN
is BEZ
conscientious JJ
, ,
he PPS
wants VBZ
to TO
study VB
the AT
patient NN

As CS
a AT
result NN
, ,
it PPS
takes VBZ
a AT
little QL
longer RBR
than CS
it PPS
would MD
on IN
the AT
outside NN
where WRB
the AT

physician NN
knows VBZ
about IN
the AT

Secondly RB
, ,
the AT
VA NN
physician NN
knows VBZ
that CS
when WRB
the AT

leaves VBZ
the AT

, ,
he PPS
is BEZ
no QL
longer RBR
going VBG
to TO
have HV
a AT
chance NN
to TO
visit VB
his PP$

So CS
he PPS
keeps VBZ
the AT

in RP

he PPS
can MD
observe VB
the AT

surgery NN

The AT

The AT

whether CS

the AT

better RBR

It PPS

In IN
my PP$

we PPSS
definitely RB
do DO

and CC
the AT
sad JJ
part NN

it PPO
is BEZ
that CS
we PPSS

one CD

which WDT

rounding VBG

and CC
we PPSS
let VB

During IN

we PPSS

which WDT

both ABX

We PPSS

The AT

Four CD

the AT

We PPSS

the AT
Lloyd's NP$-TL

worked VBD
out RP

Toward IN
the AT

of IN

we PPSS
really RB
felt VBD
that CS
we PPSS

something PN
about IN

how WRB

When WRB

the AT

disbanded VBN

we PPSS

hoped VBD
that CS

not *

no AT

There EX
apparently RB

no AT

A AT
